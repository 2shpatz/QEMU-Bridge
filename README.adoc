= Balena QEMU

== Summery

This project contains a balenaos_qemu.sh script that brings up balena QEMU devices for SIL testings

== Requirements 

Here is a list of things to check before running for the first time:

=== Host Hardware

. For best performance make sure your server includes KVM support (not a must), for a VM enable "Hardware virtualization access"

=== Host Software

. Balena-cli, for fleet/device managing, * https://github.com/balena-io/balena-cli/blob/master/INSTALL-LINUX.md[balena-cli]




== Troubleshooting 

. The device can't fully connect to the Balena cloud (appears as ! online - only heartbeat)
For full Balena cloud connection make sure your server has proxy access enabled, turn to IT for support.
